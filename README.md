# punchcard

### Background
Introducing Punchcard, an application for digital natives and migrants who want to keep a pulse on their representative government. Punchcard was built entirely with React Native--using functional components--and it pulls from Google's Civic Api to provide the user with up-to-date contest data.

### Tech
- React Hooks (useEffect, useReducer, useState, useRef)  - React Navigation (Tab, Stack, Drawer)/Nested Navigation  - React Native Animated Components/Interpolation/  - Async/Await  - Conditional Stylings  - React Native Swipe Gestures  - React Native Elements
