# punchcard

### Background
Introducing Punchcard, an application for digital natives and migrants on the go who want to keep a pulse on their representative government. Punchcard was built entirely with React Native--using functional components--and it pulls from Google's Civic Api to provide the user with up-to-date contest data. [See it live](https://exp.host/@codexguajil/punchcard) [See the InVision Prototype](https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/punchcard-ck9vsdrd900lml901ld1x33rz/play/e537b54a)
